Eventing
In node there are two kinds of events
System events
  -- libuv
  -- c++ core
  -- events coming from the computer system
  -- e.g. file finished reading
Custom events
  -- js core
  -- Events emitting from your code
  -- Event Emitter
Often events emitted from c++ emits an js event
Js doesn't have eventing, but you can fake it with node event emitter
