module.exports is passed as exports for short hand.
They do point to the same place in memory.

module.exports     exports
        \         /
          object

When you set a variable to a new value it is a new spot in memory.
Now the references between the two are broken.
exports = function() {}
module.exports     exports
        \                 \
          object         object

The thing that is returned from require is module.exports so it
will be a empty object since the reference is broken.

You can mutate exports instead of just setting it to something new.

exports.greet = function() {}
