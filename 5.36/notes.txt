In util.js there is a method that is called inherits
takes two constructors
  -- the constructor that wants to inherit
  -- the constructor that is inherited from, contains the
     methods and properties that you want

If you call inherits on an object after you have set up some methods on prototype
than they will be overwritten.
           obj1
          /    \
      proto    prop3
     /
   obj2
  /     \
prop1  prob2

Proto gets created as an empty object and connects the two objects

Basically it just adds the objects prototype to the prototype chain of the
first object
                greeter1
              /
            Greetr.prototype
          /                 \
    EventEmitter.prototype   greet()
    /     \
  on     emit

greeter1.on()
greeter1.emit()
greeter1.greet()

Many key objects in node inherits from EventEmitter
